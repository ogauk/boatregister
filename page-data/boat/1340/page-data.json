Her hull was constructed from 1&frac14;in. American redwood on 3in. sawn oak frames at 2&rsquo;6&rdquo; centres and 1&frac12;&rdquo;x 1&rdquo; steamed oak ribs at 10&rdquo; centres. Her keelson and deadwood were elm. The foredeck was 1&frac14;&rdquo; teak and the stern deck 1&frac14;&rdquo; pine. The long keel is &frac12; ton cast iron and there are an additional 1&frac14; tons of cast iron and lead internal ballast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Displacement, in cruising trim, is estimated at a little over 4 tons. The pine mast is deck stepped in a tabernacle which extends to the keel. The mast can be easily raised and lowered by one person using the sheer pole and tackle. Standing rigging is galvanised steel.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Refurbishment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Bought by Kit Platten in 1998, she has subsequently been restored to a high standard and at considerable expense, with over &pound;25,000 spent on professional assistance between 2011 - 2015. The cabin and cockpit have been completely rebuilt, the stern deck sheathed with 6mm ply and 8mm teak caulked with Sikaflex and the existing teak foredeck refastened with A4 stainless steel screws and re-caulked. The engine was repositioned and she was given a new stainless steel stern tube and prop shaft, bronze propeller and stern glands. She was sailing again in 2004 and has been extensively cruised along the East Coast during the summer whilst the internal refurbishment continued during the winter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011 she underwent a major structural overhaul which included burning off the hull, raking out all seams, stripping out any rotten planking and drenching all exposed timber with wood preservative. Frames were doubled with Iroko and ribs with steamed oak. She was re-planked with 1&frac14;&rdquo; larch and completely refastened with bronze screws or copper nails and roves. Seams were re-caulked with cotton and red lead putty. The rudder was rebuilt, the keel bolts replaced and a new galvanised steel stem band fitted. She also has a new bowsprit and boom gallows.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A Jabsco Standard toilet with bronze skin fittings is installed in the forepeak. There is ample racking for sail bags and easy access to the chain locker with 30m of galvanised chain spliced to 30m of 14mm anchorplait warp. The 20lb CQR bower anchor is stowed on the foredeck. There is also a 15lb CQR kedge anchor with 30m of 12mm anchorplait. There is one bulkhead mounted 12v lamp and wiring is in place for a second lamp if required. A &ldquo;modesty curtain&rdquo; separates the forepeak from the saloon</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The comfortable saloon extends the full width of the boat, has 5&rsquo;6&rdquo; headroom with full standing headroom under the skylight and ample locker and shelf space. The saloon table is demountable and can be stored against the forward bulkhead. There are two bulkhead mounted 12v lamps and a 12v LED reading lamp at the head of the starboard berth. The 4&rdquo; thick berth cushions were new in 2013 and have a memory foam topping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spacious galley is fitted with a gimballed Techimpex two burner gas cooker with oven (new in 2012) and there is a deep stainless steel sink with bronze water pump and faucet fed from a 25litre container in the forepeak. Additional water containers are stored under the saloon berths. Waste water is discharged overboard by an electric pump. There is generous work top space and plenty of drawers, lockers and shelves. There is a full set of china and plastic crockery, polycarbonate glasses, stainless steel cutlery and galley utensils as well as pots, pans, a pressure cooker, chopping boards, storage containers etc. etc. A fluorescent lamp is mounted on the beam shelf above the cooker &nbsp;and there is a 13a 220v twin socket for use when shore power is available. There is even an electric kettle and toaster! The engine box acts as a useful seat when working in the galley. A fire blanket is mounted adjacent to the sink and a fire extinguisher on the port side of the companionway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The navigation area has a large chart table with ample stowage for spare charts and pilot books. The bulkhead between the table and the saloon is faced with cork pin board and there is a useful bookshelf above. All instruments are within easy reach. There is a fluorescent lamp fixed to the port beam shelf as well as a flexible chart table lamp. A 13a 230v twin socket and 12v socket are mounted on the outboard bulkhead. The navigator sits on the head of the quarter berth with ample knee room under the chart table. Two 110 amp/hour sealed batteries are situated under the navigator&rsquo;s seat. The switchboard is mounted on the face of a locker fitted to the cockpit bulkhead with wiring easily accessible from inside the locker that also contains the shore powered battery charger and a16a 230v CCU. The locker has a separate space for the first aid kit, medicine box, spare fuses and torches etc. All 12v wiring is marine grade and concealed within or behind bulkheads and easily accessible via removable panels. There is a 220v ring main with twin socket outlets in the navigation and galley areas with provision for a third socket in the forward Saloon bulkhead if required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ducati engine is easily accessed via a removable cover that also acts as the companionway and as a useful seat for the galley. The engine is extremely reliable, has always started first time and, being air-cooled, is ideal for use in the shoal waters of the East Coast. It has proved very economical and burns practically no oil. The fuel tank holds 12 gallons (55 litres) and is housed under the stern deck accessible via a hatch. Above the engine and under the bridge deck is a large locker for life jackets, safety harnesses spare hats etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>On Deck</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The cockpit has a large locker with lift up lid to starboard with ample room for fuel cans, engine accessories, fenders etc. There is a smaller locker with lift up lid to port for mooring warps and 3 open fronted bins for furling ties, spare lines, and drinks bottles. The stern coaming is drilled for tiller pegs and the fittings for mounting the Autopilot are on the stern deck. There are two strong points for attaching safety harnesses. The boom gallows are mounted on adjustable posts. The upper position allows for full standing headroom under the boom and the lower position is used for sailing. The cockpit is self-draining and there are removable oak gratings and a hatch giving access to the engine fuel filter and further storage space. The engine controls are recessed to avoid potential tangling with sheets. The cockpit tent and mainsail cover were new in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &#39;Deirdre&#39; has been rigged for single handed sailing. All halyards and control lines for the sails (except the topsail and potential spinnaker) lead aft to the cockpit and there are &ldquo;on/off&rdquo; cleats for the sheets. There are no winches fitted but the staysail and jibs have two part purchases and are easily controlled even in strong winds (there are two pairs of winches available if wanted!). As she is a &ldquo;classic boat&rdquo; there are no guardrails but permanent fore and aft safety lines are rigged on the cabin top and the foredeck to which a safety harness can be clipped.</p>","image_key":"Bmqvz3","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"construction_details":"American Redwood and Larch on Oak and Iroko","designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"T.D.
