She is easily distinguished by her very low flat hull with its distinctive square counter.  She was designed by Dyevre and built by Senocal at Los Mureaux in 1916 as a bermudan sloop believed to be to the French 8.5 metric rating, and called Lola.  Built of pine on oak frames with all her 14 cwt. ballast on the keel, she came to England in 1923 to be sailed with the Island Yacht Club on the Isle of Wight.  By 1925 she was based at Orford and had acquired her present name.

She has been owned by Kevin since that time and he has established a comprehensive history of her and raced very successfully against all comers.","image_key":null,"uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel pine on oak","draft":1.3716,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":16,"head":14.58,"luff":14.5},"topsail":{"luff":15.58,"perpendicular":6.5},"length_overall":8.5344,"fore_triangle_base":4.4196,"length_on_waterline":7.1628,"fore_triangle_height":7.4158},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.5344,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:51:37.327394+00:00","website":"","beam":2.286,"air_draft":null,"reference":["Log 91/1","Log 92/1","Log A-W/94","Log S-S/95","Log Sep/97","Log Nov 97","Log Mar 98","Log Sep 98","Log Dec 98"],"builder":"baeb347d-f0d3-46d2-a91c-3611636b5b96","designer":"b3d30935-b34f-426f-98b8-e76ed693c918","design_class":"64dc772d-965c-444e-b898-61babe2767cf","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"7.5 Metre"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"L.
