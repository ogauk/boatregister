She was originally rigged as a gaff sloop and had an air cooled Ducatti diesel with a folding prop. In the right conditions and hands she is a very fast boat. Arthur Holt thinks this was the first boat to be fitted with a full size lifting keel of 3/4 ton, interchangeable gaff and bermudan rig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 1986 she passed back into Arthur Holt&#39;s hands - he had a Bermudan rig built for another long thin boat called &#39;Kraken&#39; which he transferred to &#39;Hanser&#39;, moving the mast back 5&#39; onto the coachroof. He also made a gaff main which worked on the Bermudan mast so he could take part in OGA events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fabian Bush, who trained under Arthur, acquired the boat in 1999 and he started to change things. The engine was replaced by an outboard and a tiny mizzen added for handling under sail. The mast was moved back into the original position but on a tabernacle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Latterly she has been sailed with a gaff main. The rudder and keel format have been altered and more ballast added for sail carrying capacity. A short bowsprit has been added, making the boat more of a family cruiser than a racer. A new mainsail was made in 2013 and a deeper analysis of the boat is planned.</p>","image_key":"LBJBjj","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":" Cold Moulded - 2 layers of khaya + external layer of teak over stringers and laminated frames and ply webs.
