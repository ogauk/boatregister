As a result, her garboards were sprung and a considerable amount of work was required to return her to sailing condition. She was subsequently bought by Souter Harris who campaigned her locally and around the south and east coast with some success until 1999/2000 when James Bardrick took up ownership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has been sailed hard over this period and certain parts of her structure were in need of attention in order for her to carry on to her 100th birthday. James has undertaken the mammoth task of restoring her centre line, deck and deckshelf and powerplants, both mechanical and windpowered, to their former glory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/colmolaoi/with/14394546619\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Colm&#39;s photostream on Flickr</a> for more photos of the East Coast Race, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch the video of smacks racing on the River Blackwater in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/grJakCpCbDA?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","image_key":"F5ncGw","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel larch on oak","draft":1.524,"generic_type":"Smack","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":28.58,"head":20.58,"luff":19.92},"topsail":{"luff":30,"perpendicular":14},"length_overall":12.954,"calculated_thcf":1.134,"fore_triangle_base":9.3208,"length_on_waterline":11.43,"fore_triangle_height":10.159},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":12.954,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>Originally built at Brightlingsea in 1906 she was rebuilt 2001 - 2009 at Tollesbury, by Paul Drake.</p>","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:51:37.327394+00:00","website":"","beam":3.5052,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"d025a19c-adec-4a5a-99da-a961f0746179","designer":"01ceb963-0a9a-494f-be76-bbd2893e9eba","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Charles J.
