There is a DVD of the book. Tim describes raising the mainsail as follows &ldquo;There was the piercing high pitched squeak of the wooden jaws of the gaff sliding ponderously up the mast, followed by the erratic flap and clatter of heavy canvas. ..... When the sheets were hauled in and the mainsail exerted pressure, <i>Ziska</i> groaned with the effort, then groaned again.&rdquo;<p>With Tim Severin and Ashley on <i>Ziska</i> was Trondur Patursson, a Faroese artist, who had crossed the Atlantic in 1976 with Tim in a currach to prove that it was possible for St Brendan to have discovered America from Ireland in the sixth century AD<p><b>2003</b> Takes part in Antigua Classics on her hundredth birthday winning multiple races.<p>Sold to an American who wanted to use her for long distance cruising. Unfortunately, his job meant he did not have time to sail her. <i>Ziska</i> is kept at Annapolis on Chesapeake Bay. Ashley now runs Butler &amp; Co one of the country&rsquo;s leading wooden boat builders at Penpol Creek, near Falmouth<p><b>2005</b> Sold to tall ship sailor and shipwright, Clint Thompson who moves her to Port Townsend, Washington State on West Coast of America by truck. Clint and his young family live aboard <i>Ziska</i> for 6 years, cruising locally. Clint is a friend of Ashley Butler.<p>Port Townsend is a centre for boating and maritime life with a skilled workforce. There is a wooden boat building college nearby. Events include an annual wooden boat festival. Port Townsend grew up as a Victorian port that went into decline as the railway never reached<p><b>2013</b> Clint sells <i>Ziska</i> as she is too small for his family. Brought by another Ports Townsend Owner<p><b>2017</b> Bought by Stanford Siver of Port Townsend. Stanford&rsquo;s involvement with boats started when he left his job on the East Coast of USA and enrolled in the North West Academy of Wooden Boatbuilding, near Port Townsend. With the help of a team of local shipwrights, Stanford spent two years restoring <i>Ziska</i>, before entering her to the Race2Alaska. Work included an upgraded salon, a new mast, rigging and sails.<p><b>2019</b> Takes part in the Race2Alaska from Port Townsend to Ketchikan in Alaska up the Canadian Coast in June. The Race is designed to showcase the latest in sail and wind powered technology. <i>Ziska</i> is by far the oldest and heaviest boat to take part. She completes the race in 16 days, 12 days behind the winning boat coming 22nd out of 35 starters (only 25 finished). To complete the 750-mile distance, <i>Ziska</i> had to sail 1282 miles having to tack against north westerly winds. When the wind dropped the crew had to row her 12 tonnes. The general conclusion was that <i>Ziska</i> performed well in strong winds, but less well in light winds having to be rowed at times.<p><b>2020</b> Short listed for the Classic Boat Restoration (under 40 foot) of the Year Award and the Gstaad Yacht Club Centenarian of the Year</p> <p> In 1901 the  Lancashire Sea Fisheries Committee brought a steam yacht <i>Ziska</i>, which they then renamed <i>John Fell</i>. John Aspden, Ziska's first owner was a Fisheries Bailiff in 1901 so would have been aware of the vessel.","image_key":"JvwdC5","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"construction_details":"Larch on oak carvel","designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Crossfield"},"draft":1.524,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":null,"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":11.5824,"mainsail_type":"gaff","rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"Built by Crossfields, Arnside, in 1903 <i>Ziska</i> is now based on the west coast of America.
