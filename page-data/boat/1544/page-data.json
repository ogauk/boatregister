There is a bye-law in the Fal Estuary, in Cornwall, which forbids oysters to be fished for by boats under mechanical power and even today Falmouth Working Boats from the Gaffers and Luggers boatyard can be seen dredging for shellfish under sail. This is the world&rsquo;s last Oyster dredging fleet to work under sail alone and at it&rsquo;s peak in 1924/25, there were 50 boats working the Fal fishery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plum has a glass-reinforced-plastic (GRP) hull with a wood deck and superstructure and wood (Columbian pine) spars.</p>","image_key":"bfwhcm","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"GRP hull, wood deck and superstructure","draft":1.3716,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":14.5,"head":10.75,"luff":12.67},"sailarea":7,"length_overall":7.0104,"calculated_thcf":0.882,"fore_triangle_base":5.334,"length_on_waterline":6.2484,"fore_triangle_height":7.7724},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.0104,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"Plum of Mylor is a Heard 23.
