One is the use of bronze bolts and screws instead of the original iron centre line fixings and bronze nails for the planking to frame fixings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other difference is the deck. The new deck is two layers of marine plywood sheathed in epoxy and glass overlaid with 3&quot; wide teak. This option has been selected as an improvement to the original build to increase strength, stiffness and durability &ndash; a modern deck on a traditional hull!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In building this replica they have reintroduced some of the features of the original pilot cutter which have since been lost on the &#39;Peggy&#39;. Hopefully, this will further enhance her beautiful lines. This pilot cutter is an interesting mix with the traditional lines of a pilot cutter, yet fitted out with a modern interior and equipped with all the latest technology. Internally we have selected a much more modern and luxurious finish using solid English oak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The layout has a large luxurious master cabin with an en suite head and shower. There is a traditional head in the bow and a forward cabin with two berths and two extra occasional berths. The saloon has another four berths including two occasional on the saloon seats, providing a total of ten berths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a large galley and navigational area which includes all the mod cons (and more!!) required to licence the boat as a sea school.</p>","image_key":"qKN6QP","uk_part1":"916036","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel larch on oak","draft":2.286,"generic_type":"Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":29,"head":23.17,"luff":28.33},"topsail":{"luff":31.17,"perpendicular":14.42},"sailarea":9,"length_overall":13.716,"calculated_thcf":1.136,"fore_triangle_base":8.2296,"length_on_waterline":12.1676,"fore_triangle_height":12.8016},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":13.716,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"Polly Agatha is an exact replica of the Bristol pilot cutter, Peggy, built in Falmouth, 2007.","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:51:37.327394+00:00","website":"http://www.polly-agatha.co.uk/","beam":4.1148,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"ba7746ff-a625-4270-a6b8-b90e06678211","designer":"4df1507d-c01d-4e1e-950b-f2a6f875369f","design_class":"01de4c84-0f55-42ef-8857-de9ee6eaec55","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Bristol Channel Pilot Cutter"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"E.
