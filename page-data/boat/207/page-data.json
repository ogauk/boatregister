In actual fact she is sister ship to Cherub III which was designed to have a transom stern, but was built with a canoe stern, although still a yawl. In 1930 another yawl rigged version, Galatea, was also built. Ariel probably remains Strange&#39;s only cutter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her early history is well documented as her first owner JB Kirkpatrick wrote extensively about her in Yachting Monthly between 1925 and 1933. One trip (engineless and single-handed!) was from Heybridge to the Channel Islands and back in a week. She also sailed to Spain across Biscay as detailed in Kirkpatrick&#39;s book &quot;Little Ship Wanderings&quot; (1933).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1930 she was second in The Little Ship Club&#39;s inaugural Brightlingsea to Ostend race.
