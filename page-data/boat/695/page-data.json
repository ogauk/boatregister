She replaced the anchor chain with multiplait and reorganised the main sheet arrangement, reefing and running backstays. She attended to all the rigging requirements of the 2012 insurance survey. Marion sailed East Breeze to the Beaulieu River, Marchwood Yacht Club, Newtown Creek, Island Harbour, Wootton Creek, Lymington, and Yarmouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013 Ian Macgillivray, professional boat builder of Bluff&rsquo;s Quay, Southampton advised and assisted in stripping and sheathing&nbsp; the foredeck. This was then painted with two part polyurethane primer and International Toplac. He also replaced the starboard side of the forecabin by means of a scarphe joint. The foredeck cleats were replaced and fitted with cushions below decks and some fittings regalvanised. The bobstay fittings were bolted rather than screwed to the boat. Ian also built the housing allowing the bowsprit to be run in to the boat. Marion sailed East Breeze to Yarmouth, Portsmouth and Bembridge. East Breeze was present at Cowes for the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Old Gaffers Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In spring 2014, Marion removed the quarter round beading from cockpit and side decks and Ian continued the programme of rebuild and improvement by removing the cabin sides from East Breeze and peeling away all the sheathing from side decks and cockpit. Considerable water ingress and rot was discovered. The port side deck was totally replaced as were the cockpit and cabin sides, all the cockpit flat areas, the stern deck, the bridge deck, starboard and stern inwhales and internal sternpost. Teak corner posts were added in the cock pit and forward and aft in the cabin. The cabin roof, side decks, stern deck and cockpit flats were sheathed and repainted with two part epoxy primer and two part top coat. A new locker was constructed and tiling added to allow the installation of a Taylor&rsquo;s diesel heater, the water supply relocated to below the chart table and the boat completely rewired with new batteries, cabin lights, log and echo sounder, an additional mini-contest compass and 12v sockets. Tufnell winches were installed and all works required and recommended by the 2012 insurance survey were completed. Spinlock jammers were installed to aid luff tension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marion sailed East Breeze to the Yarmouth Old Gaffers Festival then to the OGA Bembridge Rally and onwards, single handed, to the Dutch Old Gaffers Cross Country Tour, crossing the Channel from Dover to Dunkerque. She sailed 809 nautical miles in total and was away just under two months, crossing back from Dunkerque to Dover and on to Brighton and East Cowes in an engine assisted passage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original engine, a Yanmar SE8 gave trouble on this voyage by not starting when warm and was found to have a cracked cylinder head, probably due to intake of particles which impeded water supply for cooling. A replacement head was sourced and fitted for the 2015 season. In this season, Marion sailed East Breeze to the Yarmouth Old Gaffers Festival, the Gaffers&#39; Poole Rally and the Annual Rally at Cowes and Haslar. Also to Ryde and on a week&#39;s tour of creeks and rivers of The Solent taking in the Beaulieu River, Newtown, Newport, Wootton and Haslar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2016, East Breeze was once again at Bluff&#39;s Quay. Ian removed&nbsp;the starboard side cockpit upright and floor, and the YSE8 engine. Marion cleaned and painted the bilges prior to the installation of a Beta 14 engine and replacement of the wooen parts including a cockpit floor and hatch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marion sailed East Breeze to the Medina River and then in stormy conditions under three reefs to the Yarmouth Gaffers regatta. About two weeks later, Marion and East Breeze left the Solent via Yarmouth, sailed to Alderney, on to Guernsey and thence to Treguier. They continued by way of Perros Guirec, Roscoff, L&#39;Aberwrach and Isle Molene to Camaret where crew Mary Gibbs joined the ship. They continued to the Brest Festival and onwards to the Douarnenez festival, suffering a collapse of the backstays and gaff halyard. This was replaced at Douarnenez with help from Janet and Mike Gurney in Passager. Marion, Mary and East Breeze returned via Camaret to L&#39;Aberwrach, Roscoff and Morlaix where Mary left by train to rejoin her own ship. Marion continued to Trebeurden, the Treguier River, Pontrieux and Lezardrieux before crossing the channel to Guernsey, Alderney and Yarmouth prior to joining a the Solent Gaffers in the Beaulieu River at Ginns Farm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017 following routine maintenance, and the customary early season Solent Gaffers events, Marion sailed East Breeze to The Folly and on to Weymouth. She crossed Lyme Bay to the River Exe, spent a night on a buoy and then visited Topsham. She sailed by way of Brixham to Dartmouth, anchoring in the river and leaving East Breeze in Dartmouth whilst joining the Classic Channel Regatta. She rejoined East Breeze and sailed her to Salcombe and then to Fowey, returning to Plymouth to explore the harbour and Tamar River before joining the Gaffers Sou b&#39; Sou&#39; West Rally at Plymouth. She sailed in company to Salcombe and back to Dartmouth, visiting Totnes in rain and cold before joining the South West Gaffers Dittisham Rally. She then returned in company to Weymouth and to Yarmouth. The passage to Yarmouth was windier than forecast and East Breeze&#39;s mainsail disintegrated en route. Marion met former owners, the Barrs, in Yarmouth and enjoyed discussing the history of repairs and improvements to East Breeze. In late September, Marion sailed East Breeze to Lymington where she was measured for a new main by Pete Sanders who confirmed that the damaged sail was the original at 40+ years old. Marion made a new winter cover for East Breeze in late 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image_key":"WP6FjB","uk_part1":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"grp","construction_method":"unknown","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"GRP hull, ply deck & cabin","draft":0.9144,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.43842965130456,"main":{"foot":3.9624481833699097,"head":3.581443550353572,"luff":3.9624481833699097},"thcf":0.86522172,"draft":0.9144111192392099,"length_over_all":6.705681541087539,"fore_triangle_base":3.6576444769568397,"length_on_waterline":6.4008778346744695,"fore_triangle_height":6.5532796878810045},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":6.7056,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"","updated_at":"2021-01-31T17:02:40.222221+00:00","website":"","beam":2.4384,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"a6482c01-706a-469d-93db-2ccab9020581","designer":"248b3a1a-e45d-4490-8de7-aaa23ab100b9","design_class":"ffd82ea5-0656-4af6-b5b7-55bfb57c26dc","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Tamarisk 22"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"David M.
