Only the smack &#39;Gracie&#39; was about when Arthur fired his starting gun (live amo too!) &#39;Seahorse&#39; was ten minutes late, and the association secretary chose to ground in Tollesbury leavings. The race was fraught with light airs, involving much tactical kedging. &#39;Chittabob IV&#39; was first round, as expected, having taken nearly ten hours to do the 35 mile course, but on handicap &#39;Gracie&#39; took the winner&#39;s spot, being only 15 minutes astern of the ECOD.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at this archive video from British Movietone, undated but likely to be in the 1970s, showing &#39;Gracie&#39; taking part in the annual Thames Oyster Smack Race from Gravesend to Billingsgate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOJDR2zziL0\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>","image_key":"5pKzpc","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel Larch on oak","draft":1.2954,"generic_type":"unknown","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":25,"head":17,"luff":18},"sailarea":10,"length_overall":10.9728,"calculated_thcf":1.051,"fore_triangle_base":7.62,"length_on_waterline":9.144,"fore_triangle_height":8.8392},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":10.9728,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>&#39;Gracie&#39; spent her first 20 years off Clacton Beach, and was registered in 1910 to fish CK81.
