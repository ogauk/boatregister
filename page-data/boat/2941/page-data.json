Previous owner: Jeff Menzel.  History: The Delphine is a reproduction of a sharpie called the Egret that was designed by Ralph Middleton Munroe (known as Commodore Munroe) and built by A. C. Brown & Sons of Tottenville , New York, in 1886.  A gaff rigged shoal-draft cruising ketch, the Egret was for Munroe’s own use in the area of Biscayne Bay, Florida.  She is described in Commodore Munroe’s memoirs, “The Commodore’s Story”, and elsewhere in the literature on traditional boats including “American Sailing Craft” by Howard I. Chappelle and “The Sharpie Book” by Reuel B. Parker.  The Delphine was built in Marquette, Michigan, by Jeff Menzel, who finished her in 1998 and sailed her under the name Sleeping Lady until William J. Kohler purchased her in 2006.  Mr. Menzel built her from plans drawn in 184 for WoodenBoat Publications, Inc., by Joel White and Dave Dillion. Rig details: The Delphine is gaff rigged, with 229 sq. ft. of sail area in main and mizzen sails that are roughly equal in size.  She has no standing rigging, no bow sprit, and no jib, spinnaker or top sails.","image_key":null,"uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Wood  flatbottom sharpy, glass sheathed.","draft":0.3048,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":10.25,"head":6.08,"luff":15.25},"mizzen":{"foot":9.67,"head":5,"luff":15.08},"length_overall":8.5862,"length_on_waterline":6.9098},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.5862,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:51:37.327394+00:00","website":"","beam":2.286,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"0551033f-9903-4132-b697-05d51dff6f48","designer":"4facfae7-08ab-4710-a01b-a80fc416ffd9","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Ralph M.
