She was built without an engine, and appears on the Lloyds Register of Yachts until 1911 as a 9 ton cutter without motor propulsion.</p><p>After the start of her unsuccesssful round the world cruise in 1934, still without an engine but now gaff schooner rigged, she was sold to an ice manufacturer in Plymouth. In 1938 her new owner renamed her Icicle IV and had installed a Thornycraft 'Handy Billy' petrol engine. During the war years she was preserved, being laid up afloat with 3&quot; of asphalt covering her decks.</p><p>In 1954 she changed hands again and, after several years re-fitting in Plymouth, Tony Williams, his brother Trevor and family set off to France in 1959 finally arriving in St Tropez in the summer of 1961. Icicle IV remained in the Bay of Canubiers until purchased by her current owner, William MacInnes who changed her name back to SIF in 1988, registering her under the American flag.</p><p>The curent owner has undertaken two programmes of restoration between 1985 and 2005, alongside taking part in Mediterranean races, and winning on several occasions. Since 2005, there has been no more major restoration, just regular maintenance and her owner asserts that, 'SIF is in sound shape and is well maintained, using products that permit the proverbial 'amateur' to care for this yacht, truly a 'one man&rsquo;s' boat! I am confident she will pass any survey desired!'</p><p>After 29&nbsp;years with her, she is for sale with <a href=\"http://www.woodenships.co.uk/sailing-yachts/historic-schooner/\" target=\"_blank\">yacht brokers Wooden Ships</a> and William MacInnes asks:</p><blockquote>Could this gaff schooner be your 'old gaffer' on the Med? Her home port is Saint-Tropez and she is well known on the Mediterranean classic yacht racing circuit since 1985. SIF is a 'normal' classic yacht; too small to interest the rich 'investor yachtsmen'! My wife and I cruise SIF by ourselves; she is fun to sail, very well equipped for cruising and is set up for easy maintenance by myself. There are berths available for participation in this summer's regattas and the cruises between them. My wife and I would be pleased to have you trial sail on SIF this summer, with the hope that you might make an offer for full or part ownership.</blockquote>","image_key":"NRzwgx","uk_part1":"937425","rig_type":"Schooner","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"unknown","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel pitch pine on oak","draft":1.777,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.9596439892709094,"length_over_all":13.639965861984882},"hull_form":"long keel sloping forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":12.6736,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>Named after the Scandinavian goddess, SIF was built&nbsp;in Odense, Denmark, 1894.
