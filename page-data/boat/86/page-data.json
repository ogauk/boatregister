She entered the Falmouth classics in June 2018 and 2019. In May 2019 her keel fell off (3/4&quot; bolt rusted through) and keel had to be manufactured from drawings. This was completed in time to the Falmouth classics and she is back in the water. She also attended the SW Gaffers parade of sail at Plymouth in Jul 2019 overnighting at Cawsand and Polperro.</p>","image_key":"wvpD9T","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Cutter","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"clinker","construction_details":"Clinker, iroko on oak with copper rivets and a galvanised iron keel, cast iron ballast on keel and internal.","draft":0.762,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":2.13362594489149,"main":{"foot":4.114862228724701,"head":3.2512557912704216,"luff":6.553291880029261},"thcf":0.877,"draft":0.7620214581809314,"topsail":{"luff":1.5240185320653499,"perpendicular":1.21921482565228},"sailarea":33.9800704141645,"length_over_all":5.84207510363326,"length_over_spars":7.010485247500609,"fore_triangle_base":2.997256766642282,"length_on_waterline":5.334077054376981,"fore_triangle_height":5.4864667154352595},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":5.843,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"<p>Mayblossom is a New Blossom Class Yacht designed by John Leather and built in 1973.</p>","updated_at":"2021-03-23T08:43:27.29146+00:00","website":"","beam":2.1336,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"8ec886aa-118b-44a4-becc-f6f0e38b4235","designer":"1a6c3643-688e-4b25-b088-2520172edd7d","design_class":"238d8d9a-b5c4-4065-960e-24e8ccfb8545","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"clinker"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"New Blossom Class"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"John Leather"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Patten P or Gale H. and Sons"},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[{"asking_price":3950}],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
