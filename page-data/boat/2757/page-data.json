Fully equipped, 4 berths, cooker inside and outside, ready to sail, with a marinised VW Golf 40 Hp diesel engine. As a working boat, with weather helm typical for this craft, she is easy to handle. I sailed her single-handed on inland waters. A sound ship, she needs some attention as she has not sailed since 2012.</p>","sold":null,"summary":null,"updated_at":"2020-05-03T10:13:13.258898+00:00"}],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
