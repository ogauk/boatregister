At some point, probably in the 1920s, she was renamed &#39;White Heather&#39;. She had a mixed career of oyster dredging, racing and day sailing. An extensive restoration was carried out around 1960, including the fitting of an iron keel. After a change of owner in the late 1960s she was neglected, sunk by a paint float from Falmouth Docks and subsequently salvaged to Penryn Creek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1970 she was transported by road and ferry to Guernsey and got sailing again. From 1973 she was based at Ferrybridge, Portland Harbour, back under the name &#39;Little Apple&#39;. She was the first winner of the Edgar March memorial trophy. A feat repeated some years later. She was at the first Bucktrout and St Malo Rally in 1977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1979 the cabin top was added.
