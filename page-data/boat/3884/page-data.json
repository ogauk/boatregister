The yard became Summers & Payne in 1890 before being taken over lock stock and workforce by Camper and Nicholson in the early 1900s.  Mr Shaw was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron and after two years of racing (with unknown results) he sold her to Avery Jones of Bristol, the son of the mayor.  By 1902 she had been converted to cutter fig and renamed Samphire.  Fully restored and converted for charter in 1991 at the Bristol yard of Storms’l Services’ and fitted with Noble Marine spars, by 2010 she was sitti ng idle on the South Coast.  After another refit at the Bristol Classic Boat Company she was returned to a yawl rig and re-converted below to echo her elegance of form and her pedigree as a Victorian gentleman’s racing yacht.
