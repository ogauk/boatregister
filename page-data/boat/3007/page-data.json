She then had a taller mast, longer bowsprit and a gaff rig. She may have had an outboard well installed and was kept on a swinging mooring in the West Country.</p><p>She was bought in 2006 by a Mr Bullough, in Bere Ferris, who launched her twice. Oliver and Susan Nares purchased her in 2010 and have carried out much work. They have installed a hatch in the foredeck and both the fore and afterdecks now have laid iroko decking. Buoyancy tanks have been made for each side with side benches above. The cockpit has a slatted iroko floor and the running rigging has been improved. She retains her original tan main, but now has a slightly larger cream jib.</p>","image_key":null,"uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"GRP ","draft":0.3566,"generic_type":"Dayboat","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":9.83,"head":8,"luff":6.67},"sailarea":1,"moving_keel":true,"draft_keel_up":0.3566,"length_overall":4.8768,"calculated_thcf":0.792,"draft_keel_down":0.9144,"moving_keel_type":"Centreboard","length_over_spars":5.8918,"fore_triangle_base":2.0818,"length_on_waterline":4.7244,"fore_triangle_height":4.2672},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":4.8768,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"Owners Oliver and Susan Nares believe the hull was made at Martin Heard's yard and completed as a ‘home build’ , probably by one of his workforce.","updated_at":"2021-01-26T13:48:57.061104+00:00","website":"","beam":1.6764,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"ee814a69-d5ad-46d9-88a9-a0598ae6d33b","designer":"b1525089-031a-47bc-b7d8-7236987096a7","design_class":"11aace65-18e9-4ec8-b204-763199e59f90","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Clovelly Picarooner"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Martin Heard"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Sloop"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Dayboat"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Martin Heard","notes":null},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
