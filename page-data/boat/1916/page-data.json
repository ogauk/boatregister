She was designed by Norman Dallimore and built by Cole &amp; Wiggins. Her first owner was Squire Taylor. She competed in Southend Yachting Week in the 1920s with some success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was kept on the River Crouch until the 1930s, and following new ownership was moved to the north east coast and is recorded in the Royal Northumberland YC yearbook from 1939.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1949 she was cast ashore at Blyth, resulting in serious damage but she was rebuilt. She was dismasted off Blyth in 1956 and is recorded as being sailed by Edward Cartner at Blyth, 1954 - 56.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1977 Rodney Mitchell sold &#39;Squib&#39; to another RNYC member, Spencer Johnstone and about five or six years later she was sold again to Graydon<br />\r\nDawson of Sunderland YC. Dawson sailed her for two or three seasons and then laid her up ashore on a farm at Herrington. In 1988 she was reported as being near derelict. Her next known owner (c1988) was Dave Raggett, RNLI NE Division surveyor, who in turn sold her to Ian Fairclough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between 1996 and 1999, lan Fairclough had &#39;Squib&#39; totally restored. Much of the hull was rebuilt by Mike Cussins at Blackburn. Ian himself re-decked and re-rigged her with a new mast. New sails to the original plan were made by W Sails of Leigh. In 1998 - 1999 she was based at Fleetwood Marina and used for day sailing off the port and in the River Wyre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2008, she was moved to Britanny.</p>","image_key":null,"uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Clinker - Mahogany on Oak.
