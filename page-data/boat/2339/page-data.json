This magnificent sea boat has looked after her present owners for over 20 years, providing a fulfilling and enjoyable retirement. Unfortunately, it is now time to ask someone else to plan her summer cruising programme and look after her. Professionally-built in 1980, Nightingale’s mono-coque, ferro-cement hull and decks have been uniquely sheathed and encapsulated in epoxy resin in order to provide the driest and most comfortable traditionally rigged boat imaginable. The four large berths, plus a pilot berth, enable four adults to make distance passages in comfort. Fitted with a 25 hp, 3 cylinder Vetus/Mitsubishi engine and 250 litre fuel tank for long-distance cruising. All electronic equipment is in full working order, including the fully-integrated trim-tab steering system with numerous spares. Comprehensive sail wardrobe for both cruising and racing, plus many extras including life raft, rigid and inflatable dinghy if required. <p> Lying Cowes, Isle of Wight. <p> Ron Hanson: 07780 616747 | hansonr.rh@gmail.com","sold":null,"summary":null,"updated_at":"2020-06-10T19:44:15.695055+00:00"}],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
