The book also contains line drawings and sail plan.&nbsp; She was in the ownership of one family for 42 years.</p>\n<p>Between 2005&nbsp;and 2015, RAWANAH sailed thousands of miles to the Outer and Inner Hebrides, Orkney and Faroe Isles, Scilly Isles, Ireland three times including a circumnavigation in July 2008. She won the 'Cock o' the Bristol Channel Race' with courses of 80 and 50 miles competing against the Bristol Channel cutter fleet. In all those sea miles RAWANAH proved herself to be a sea kindly, robust vessel, gentle on the helm, making good passage time and capable in rough weather.</p>\n<p>Rawanah is currently undergoing restoration in Crinan Boatyard and will hopefully be afloat in 2022.</p>","image_key":"v6gTDt","uk_part1":"164354","spar_material":null,"rig_type":"Ketch","construction_material":"wood","construction_method":"carvel","construction_details":"Carvel","draft":1.4996,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"beam":3.0785174347720066,"main":{"foot":4.26725188978298,"head":3.627164106315533,"luff":6.2484759814679345},"thcf":0.999255819,"draft":1.493538161424043,"mizen":{"foot":3.0480370641306997,"luff":6.272860277980979},"topsail":{"luff":5.334064862228725,"perpendicular":2.43842965130456},"length_over_all":10.698610095098756,"fore_triangle_base":5.273104120946111,"length_on_waterline":9.525115825408436,"fore_triangle_height":9.723238234576932},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":10.921,"mainsail_type":"gaff","short_description":"A Tahiti Ketch, one of at least two built by Harry King","updated_at":"2021-03-07T10:51:13.691369+00:00","website":"","beam":3.301,"air_draft":null,"reference":["Log Dec 2007"],"builder":"63963d6b-c36a-4c35-9c0d-d42fb6cf4645","designer":"c4721fcb-96c6-463f-a516-3f206a95f6ba","design_class":"095e1bc1-a693-4a1e-86f8-0e97080dc730","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"carvel"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Tahiti Ketch"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"John G.
