In 2007 she won the &lsquo;Cock of the Channel&rsquo; race. The Gafers Log article reproduced below incorrectly credits Maurice Griffiths with the design. It is possible Griffiths was involved with the Pin Mill built boats as both he and Hanna were yachting journalists. <h4>Cock o&rsquo; the Bristol Channel Cup: â€¨&lsquo;Rawanah&rsquo; takes honours<br />by John Cochrane<br />first published in Gaffers Log December, 2007</h4><blockquote>This event began back in 1936 as a race for the Bristol Channel pilot cutter owners who put up the Cock o&rsquo; the Bristol Channel challenge cup. Entry was restricted to pilot cutters and with all 46 winners engraved on the cup, there are some pretty well known names on display.</blockquote><blockquote>Organised by Barry Yacht Club in association with the Bristol Channel Pilot Cutters Owners Association it is now open to pilot cutters and all other gaff-rigged challengers. The 2007 event took place on the August Bank Holiday weekend and it is hoped to re-establish the race as an annual principal fixture in the Bristol Channel.</blockquote><blockquote>Proceedings began with a dinner on the Saturday evening with the start at 0700 hours on Sunday 26 August off the entrance to Barry. The course was nearly 80 miles, leaving the Horseshoe Buoy off Ilfracombe to starboard and likewise the West Scarweather Buoy off Swansea Bay. The finish was back at Barry YC in a line west to east. There were just four entrants, three BC pilot cutters &lsquo;Mascotte&#39;, &lsquo;Peggy&rsquo; and &lsquo;Olga&rsquo;, with the OGA represented by John Cochrane&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rawanah&#39;.</blockquote><blockquote>A Maurice Griffiths designed gaff ketch, &lsquo;Rawanah&#39; is a double ender built in 1935 at the request of a customer who wanted a boat able to be sailed single-handed around the coasts of North West Scotland.</blockquote><blockquote>At 35 feet, Rawanah was up against strong opposition and had been invited to join the race with a scratch crew from the Underfall Boat Yard in Bristol City Dock. We crossed the start line ahead of a fleet at 0700 hrs on a windless August Bank Holiday. The first mark, Horseshoe Buoy off Ilfracombe, was some 37 miles just south of west, the wind was meant to be from the NE but failed to show except in little puffs. The fleet stayed fairly compact though after eight hours &lsquo;Rawanah&#39; was in the lead, her lighter weight, 10 tons, and ease of switching sails to accommodate the puffs being in her favour. Soon the tide turned and we all had to anchor, &lsquo;Rawanah&#39; had stayed some 3 miles off the Devon Coast, the pilot cutters had positioned themselves much closer in.</blockquote><blockquote>Over the next four hours it appeared they had made the right choice as they were eventually seen inching up the coast whilst we were stuck in a 3 knot tide. So it was up anchor and sail to close on the fleet to get whatever was making their progress. No sooner had we taken up position behind them than the breeze fell and we all began to drift east on the tide, ending up a good mile behind our previous anchoring point.</blockquote><blockquote>The tide turns and the fleet, with us in the rear, move west, a very small zephyr aids us. We note Mascotte well in the lead but surprisingly not turning at the Horseshoe Buoy but appearing to head for Lundy in the grip of the tide, Peggy and Olga turned at the buoy and made for Swansea.<br />The light dims and we approach the Horseshoe at 1 knot plus tide going for the gap between the buoy and the overfalls some 4 cables to the south. When 2 cables off Horseshoe we are hit by a force 5 plus out of nowhere, the promised northeasterly had arrived.</blockquote><blockquote>The Underfall Crew got the topsail, yankee and large staysail down and replaced them with more appropriate cloth. In all the bustle we lost way and heading so went right through the overfalls. Rawanah is a good sea boat and with the new rig pulling took us through without a wave in the cockpit, though the foredeck crew had a cooling experience. Darkness fell and we rounded Horseshoe set a course for West Scar.</blockquote><blockquote>We could see the lights of one if not two of the fleet but they vanished before dawn. At around 0400 hrs we were only three cables off West Scar on our third attempt to make the buoy in ever shifting winds; I went below. The watch took a further three hours to round West Scar, every approach having been rendered useless by sudden and contrary wind shifts.</blockquote><blockquote>We crept eastwards, along the banks, but the tide turned and we had to anchor. By mid morning there was enough sea breeze, to beat the tide. Up went the sails all eight of them, for this was a &lsquo;boat on boat&rsquo; race, with no handicap rules to prevent on the spot imaginative sail plans. We knew the main fleet was ahead, and shortly learned that they had abandoned the race owing to time and motored in. Rawanah was the only boat to sail the course and 35 hours after the start, crossed the finish line with all eight sails still aloft and took the Honours. The underdogs from Underfall had prevailed. There are many ways to win a race, persistence being one of them.</blockquote><blockquote>Barry Yacht Club hope more old gaffers will join the fray next year. We have a title to defend so hope to be there. The Challenge Cup is magnificent almost dwarfing our smallest crew member, well worth trying to get your boat&rsquo;s name on it.</blockquote>","image_key":"v6gTDt","uk_part1":"164354","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel","draft":1.4996,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":14,"head":11.92,"luff":20.5},"mizzen":{"foot":10,"luff":20.58},"topsail":{"luff":17.5,"perpendicular":8},"length_overall":10.921,"calculated_thcf":1,"fore_triangle_base":5.2822,"length_on_waterline":9.525,"fore_triangle_height":9.7292},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":10.921,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"A Tahiti Ketch, one of at least two built by Harry King","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:51:37.327394+00:00","website":"","beam":3.301,"air_draft":null,"reference":["Log Dec 2007"],"builder":"63963d6b-c36a-4c35-9c0d-d42fb6cf4645","designer":"c4721fcb-96c6-463f-a516-3f206a95f6ba","design_class":"095e1bc1-a693-4a1e-86f8-0e97080dc730","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Tahiti Ketch"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"John G.
