Father sailed the West Country, the Channel Isles and N. Brittany with his sons. He and I had one of the best sails I can remember, from the Dart to the Folly Inn on the Isle of Wight, where I took over maintenance with my wife and children. Father still sailed with us occasionally, to Chichester, Beaulieu and Poole. He also sailed with my brother and my Boss at BHC, to France.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later in 1972, I joined the RNLI, and &#39;Jo&euml;lle&#39; moved with us to Poole. Amongst other things we were able to drop the keel and replace keel bolts, totally re-deck with Trakmark and re-engine the Vedette with a Perkins Diesel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a family we sailed to Alderney, Guernsey and the South Coast. On the passage home we heard Concorde&rsquo;s double &lsquo;Bang&rsquo;. One of the best family passages ever.</p>\r\n</blockquote>","image_key":"RqLrtw","uk_part1":"183718","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel larch on oak, steel floors, Copper and Silicon Bronze fastened","draft":1.2649,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":12.25,"luff":30.33},"length_overall":7.3152,"calculated_thcf":0.858,"length_over_spars":8.9916,"fore_triangle_base":2.5908,"length_on_waterline":6.3764,"fore_triangle_height":7.3152},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.3152,"mainsail_type":"bermudan","sail_type":{"name":"bermudan"},"short_description":"<p>A Yachting World 5 Tonner, &#39;Jo&euml;lle&#39; was built in 1947&nbsp;at Philips Yard, Dartmouth.</p>","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:51:37.327394+00:00","website":"","beam":2.5725,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"c7ac6200-7aa7-4161-a80f-a1955ff76709","designer":"2c4f12ba-8608-4078-a0eb-129504d5785f","design_class":"fdede751-0f7d-4921-ad3b-7041dd7de504","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Yachting World 5 Tonner"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Robert Clark Ltd"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Philip and Son","notes":null},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[{"asking_price":6000,"flexibility":"normal","offered":null,"price_flexibility":{"text":"normal"},"reduced":false,"sales_text":"<p>\"Jo&euml;lle\" is a Yachting World 5 Tonner, built in 1947&nbsp;at Philips Yard, Dartmouth.
