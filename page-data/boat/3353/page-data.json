He fitted it out rigged with a low-aspect standing lug with a boom and a jib set on the bowsprit. He sold it on to Tom Cregeen at Castletown, who later sold it on to Alex Merchant at Port St Mary IOM, who re-fitted it with a gaff rig. Alex sold it on to a chap who never went to sea&nbsp;and it fell into disrepair, abandoned ashore. In late 2017, I bought the pretty well wrecked boat, having had my eye on the project for some time. I already have the gaffer Genesta II, which needs at least two and preferably three people to sail it, so the&nbsp;retirement plan was to put together a boat with a simple rig that could be sailed alone or short-handed whenever the weather permits.</p><p>I like&nbsp;the look of the Romilly 22 mainsail and mast, so set about looking for a used mast and was lucky to find&nbsp;one in the NW of England. A pal brought it over on top of his trailer yacht. Reading up on the Memory 19, it seems they need&nbsp;500 kgs of ballast. I thought&nbsp;that water ballast would be handy. Keeping the boat ashore on its trailer, I could let it drain while towing up the slipway and reduce the &quot;shore&quot; weight fast. There&#39;s 200 or so photos&nbsp;of this re-build on my&nbsp;Facebook page (set to public), among which, the ballast tanks each side of the centre-board case can be seen. The 4-inch tubes let the tanks&nbsp;fill a or&nbsp;drain&nbsp;in about 30 seconds. The ballast water level just kisses the under side of the sealed sole, which in turn is self-draining above for sailing purposes with bailers set in wells each side. It works very well, thankfully, as it was an experiment from start to finish.&nbsp;As it happens, 600 kgs of ballast goes in, which makes the boat solid as a raft, virtually doubling its dry weight of 750 kgs. I also put 60 kgs of lead chippings and resin into the keel voids fore and aft while accessible.</p><p>For light airs, I thought the single standing lug&nbsp;might need a bit of help, so decided to retain the existing&nbsp;sprit and fit&nbsp;a rope-luffed jib. Works well rigged with a&nbsp;tackline, which can also used for the&nbsp;assymetric kite so long as there&#39;s a crew person aboard to pull all the string.</p><p>There&#39;s not enough space under&nbsp;the sole to stash the outboard, so it has to live on the transom, however, this is often a blessing when trying to get through the Calf Sound and the wind vanishes on you - quite a lot of currents around the IOM, so safety-first! Haven&#39;t tested it yet but&nbsp;I suspect that it will quickly self-right from a knockdown. When ballasted, there&#39;s all that&nbsp;weight below the sole and plenty of buoyancy each side above the sole in the sealed fore and aft lockers/seats. Once upright it&#39;s self-draining above the sole.</p><p>Isle of Man Pleasure Craft Registry no. 1688</p>","image_key":"pmvPsG","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Hull GRP with wood trim, carbon mast, alloy yard, wooden bowsprit.","draft":0.4572,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":12.3,"head":15.5,"luff":12},"moving_keel":true,"length_overall":5.7912,"draft_keel_down":1.0668,"moving_keel_type":"Centreboard","length_over_spars":6.4008,"length_on_waterline":5.7912},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":5.7912,"mainsail_type":"lug","sail_type":{"name":"lug"},"short_description":"Skian is an early Memory 19, purchased as a wreck in 2017,&nbsp;rebuilt as a&nbsp;lugger with water ballast system, re-cycled&nbsp;Romilly 22 mast and new mainsail, launched May 2018.","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:51:37.327394+00:00","website":"","beam":2.1946,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"4ff042c0-46a4-46b6-931f-01f988d0c9bc","designer":"aaec4851-401d-4719-bd23-e80eb778816b","design_class":"7f37acf8-4c7d-4b53-a879-8ea433d372fd","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Memory 19"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Anthony Robinson"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Sloop"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Liverpool Boat Co.
