MuiPaper-rounded"><p>Rumour had it that &#39;Quiver&#39; was built as a tender for the skipper of the racing yacht &#39;Arrow&#39;. Michael Miller had owned her for 16 years in 1971 when he and his godson, Richard Penn, set out for the OGA Rally in Alderney.</p>

<p>Michael Miller&#39;s article recalling the sinking of &#39;Quiver&#39; was first published in the OGA Newsletter, July 1971.</p>

<blockquote>Richard and I set sail from Chichester on Saturday 29th May with every intention of attending the Old Gaffers Rally at Braye Harbour, Alderney during the Spring Bank Holiday weekend.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&#39;Quiver&#39; was in good fettle, despite a somewhat hurried finale to the fitting out; her topsides gleamed and looked fine from a range of twenty feet; the engine pushed her down the harbour at a satisfactory rate; and a new no. 2 jib meant that we had no worries about fresh winds. We were stored up for a fortnight&rsquo;s cruise with the Rally as a first stop, and all was right with the world.</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, emerging from Chichester Harbour, the wind appeared to be blowing directly from Alderney, so it was going to be a long haul to get there. He were just able to fetch into the Solent, and, in fact, got right through to Yarmouth without a tack, intending to pause there for the first night. However, finding that we had some tide and several hours of daylight in hand, we decided to push on to Poole, making as much westing as we could in the day, and hoping for a more favourable wind next day.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sunday morning offered much the same, and as the tide would not serve till afternoon, we went up to the Town Quay to top up petrol and water. This accomplished, we emerged from Poole Harbour to find that the wind was rather more Southerly than on Saturday, making it still a dead beat to Alderney, so we took a tack out to clear St. Albans Head, with the intention of putting in to Portland or Weymouth for the night; from here, surely, we would get a clear fetch for Braye. However, as we closed St. Albans, we ran out of wind (as I always do just there), and we bumped rather untidily through the Race just as Richard was serving supper. Not fancying motoring all the way to Weymouth, we decided to put into Lulworth Cove for tho night; it was our first visit there, and conditions were ideal for this somewhat eerie anchorage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Monday morning produced a very light breeze from the South, still on the nose for Braye, so we decided to abandon crossing the Channel and head West; a long tack out to clear Portland Race would leave us free for crossing Lyme Bay, and we might look in at Exmouth or some other Devon port not previously visited.</blockquote>

<blockquote>However (and this proves the danger of telling your friends and/or Coastguard where you are heading for) the wind gradually veered so that we found that we were, after all, heading for Alderney. So we pressed on.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Soon after dark the wind died altogether; I noticed that the log-line was hanging vertically, and you can&#39;t go slower than that. A careful look round the horizon revealed that there were no less than five ships, in widely different directions, all showing us both red and green. I reckon that that is the moment to push the button; I did, and got out of that bit of water a bit sharpish.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We anchored in Braye Harbour soon after sunrise on Tuesday morning, and after a leisurely breakfast went ashore to discover what had happened to the Rally. I was unable to find anyone who knew of any Old Gaffers visiting during the weekend, but as there had been a huge influx of English boats of all kinds, and the natives were still recovering from the impact, it was hardly surprising they had not noticed our little lot (if any).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The lunchtime shipping forecast indicated that it would blow up from the northeast during the afternoon, and already there were signs of this happening. As Braye harbour is no place to remain in a north-easter if you want to stay in your bunk all night, we decided to take the evening tide and nip down to Guernsey. This we did, starting with a light wind as we felt our way through the Swinge, which became moderate as we cleared the land, and gave us a good run down to St. Peter Port which we entered just after dark.</blockquote>

<blockquote>By Friday morning we were fed up with hanging around. The forecast was offering 4 to 6 ENE, and appeared to be right for once. The visibility was not very clever, but sounded to be better the further south and west one went. We decided to head for Lannion Bay in the eastern end of Morlaix Bay; it appeared to be easy of access by day or night (we should probably arrive in the dark, and those French leading lights are terrific), was reputed to be good holding in firm sand, and should provide a cosy anchorage on a weather shore. Furthermore, it was downhill all the way. We did not then realise how steep that hill was to be.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The direct route from St Martin&#39;s Point (S.E. corner of Guernsey) took us between Les Sept Iles and Les Triagoz, two of the reefs lying off the Brittany coast, then between Les Triagoz and Ile Grande, the latter being on the &#39;corner&#39; of Morlaix Bay, there being a safe gap of over three miles between the two.</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, this course was dead downwind, and as the wind was a bit fresh for spinnaker work for a crew of two, it would have meant a very tiring day at the tiller. So we decided to make a dog-leg of it, and steer due West until the DR put us north of Les Sept Iles, then due South until we found them. This worked very well, enabling us to keep the headsails drawing all the time, especially when the wind fell light during the afternoon, at which time we shook out the reefs with which we had started, and changed up from no. 2 to no. 1 jib.</blockquote>

<blockquote>During the afternoon we saw a French fishing boat executing some alarming manoeuvres, and stood by to take evasive action in view of the stories one has heard of yachts being attacked by such vessels; however it seemed that she was only locating and picking up her pots on the banc des langoustiers, and we were able to exchange cheery greetings as we passed them, kedged by their gear.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Soon after dark, we picked up the Les Sept Iles light where expected, and crossing this with a radio bearing on Les Roches Douvres, got a satisfactory fix which showed that we were back on our rhumb line. Incidentally, Roches Douvres was the only radio beacon of any use in this area, as all the more distant ones (Casquets, Start Point, Ushant etc.) had so much interference on them that it was impossible to get anything like an accurate nul. Being quite happY with the fix, we altered back to the original course and picked up the light on Les Triagoz where expected, fine on the starboard bow. We were now sailing on a dead run, boom to port and staysail goose-winged to starboard. The log was giving us 5 knots, the fixes indicated that we were making good 31/2, which confirmed the rather meagre information gleaned from the charts and tidal stream atlas that there was a 11/2 knot head tide. This tide was supposed to run till about 0400, dropping to about one knot in the last hour.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Until about 0130 the sky was clear though the visibility was still apparently poor, and a brilliant moon, three-wuarter full, moved steadily round until it was right in our track. If only it had stayed there, but it was not to be. Some heavy cloud came up from the south, across the wind, and blotted out all light, leaving us with nothing but the two lighthouses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>By 0200 we had drawn abreast of Les Sept Iles , and I had a feeling that we were being set somewhat to the S.E., towards the outlying dangers at the western end of that reef. I therefore altered course more westerly, until the Les Triagoz light was just open to port, for about half an hour, and until I was satisfied that we were well clear of Les Sept Iles. I then altered back about double the amount until Les Triagoz was well open in the Starboard rigging; a quick check on the chart confirmed that at 31/2 knots made good (and nothing had changed to alter this), we would clear the eastern tip of the Les Triagoz reef by about 11/4 miles, a comfortable margin. At about 0300, I was just contemplating resuming the compass course , when &lsquo;Quiver&rsquo;, with a resounding crash, stopped dead.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is, of&#39; course, no excuse for wrecking one&rsquo;s ship on a well-charted reef, especially when one can see two lighthouses and has a commanding wind. There are, perhaps, reasons. I will suggest three. The first is that during that last hour we had done the full 5 miles over the ground; in other words we had lost the 11/2 knots head tide which we had been experiencing, and which we should have had for another hour at least. One can only assume thnt it was masked by the reef into whose shadow we had sailed; there may even have been a counter-eddy: at any rate we were undoubtedly 11/2 miles further on than I thought we were.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The second reason may have been that I made my detour by eye on the lighthouse, rather than on compass courses - not very seamanlike. The third reason was undoubtedly because it was 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning. We both felt wide awake, and were thoroughly enjoying the ride. I was (thank God) at the helm myself, while Richard was below planning the next move. But at that hour one is not at one&#39;s brightest, we may have been taking careless bearings, plotting carelessly, or simply doing our sums wrong; we shall never know, as the deck log and chart went dowm with everything else.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the initial impact, which probably broke the stem and certainly opened up the hood ends, &lsquo;Quiver&rsquo; shook herself free of the half-tide rock she had struck, luffed a bit, and went charging off again into the dark. She took a great tombstone square on the bowsprit end, and again stopped dead; in the dim light from the cabin one had the feeling of being in a flooded graveyard, with great slabs of granite sticking up all round, and the water boiling on unseen tombs beneath. She swung round, hinging on the bowsprit, until the port bilges found some of these on which she then pounded for several minutes. We let go all sheets to try to take some of the weight out of it, but the swell kept her pounding until she finally slid clear in a northerly direction. To keep her quiet (and reduce the frightful din of flogging sails), we furled the jib and backed the staysail leaving the main sheet free; thus hove to, she fore reached at about a knot in water which within &#39;a few yards gave a depth of 35 fathoms. We had hit the top of a 200 foot cliff!</blockquote>

<blockquote>A quick look below revealed a hopeless situation; Richard was already on the pump, but the water in the cabin was rising at an alarming speed. Water was gushing in both sides of the stem forward, under the port bunk, and again under the cockpit. It would not have been easy to try to deal with one puncture in force five on a pitch black night in a fair old seaway; four or more holes were out of the question - we had to abandon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While Richard set about releasing the dinghy (9 ft. Nautisport, fully inflated, upside down on the coachroof), I started in on the flares. My main armament was some seven or eight of the &#39;Roman Candle&#39; type; they burn a steady red flare in your hand, while throwing up a succession of red balls to a very satisfactory height. They all went off beautifully, and the display must have lasted at least four minutes, possible longer; the only snag was that there was no audience. The mainland coast was a good three miles off, but the visibility was much less than that; I felt sure that the lighthouse should be keeping a watch, but at 0300?</blockquote>

<blockquote>We started loading up the dinghy: oars, rowlocks, pump, bailer; food? a big plastic gash-bag, shove in cakes, biscuits, tarts, tie a knot in it; water? all in the tank, tiny galley pump, no container to hand: At that moment, six long-life milk cartons conveniently floated out of their locker, in they went; what next?</blockquote>

<blockquote>I grabbed my wallet and travellers cheques; personal kit - one large travel bag each; next? my second bag, with all the ships and personal papers - in it went (it wasn&#39;t until two hours later that I realised that it was the wrong second bag; all I saved was a lot of useless hardware). By this time the water was over the cabin bunks, slowing down a bit as it had more room to spread out, and the relative buoyancy increased, but still rising visibly. We grabbed a few more bits and pieces, but then decided we had better get out in case she took a wave into the cockpit and plunged suddenly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We had been something over ten minutes, probably about quarter of an hour from the first impact. After we let go, &lsquo;Quiver&rsquo; went on fore reaching in a northerly direction, while we skirted drifting rapidly WSW. The direct cabin light disappeared quite quickly over our limited horizon, but the glow from it on the sails could be seen for another five minutes or so as she sailed sluggishly into the darkness. Then she just disappeared.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I won&#39;t go into all the sordid details of the next ten hours. It was a hell of a long time. Every quarter of an hour or so a wave would sweep right over us, to make sure that we werekept as cold and wet as possible. We bailed it all out again, though there was not really much point . We never saw a suspicion of land or vessel the whole time. Cramp was rather trying. I found that I had in my pocket my plastic &#39;OffShore&#39; hand bearing compass. It was comforting to confirm, by sighting up wind, that we were being blown WSW, and that therefore France lay somewhere to leeward. I tried rowing, but found that I could not do anything very effective except in short bursts which were very tiring. I felt however that I had to try to do something useful, so kept gently paddling across the wind in a generally southerly direction, thereby reducing the possibility of missing France altogether. We decided that we really did not know what the tide might be doing to us. Even if we had managed to grab any charts or pilot books which were floating around in the cabin, they would have dissolved before we could have made any use of them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sometime about midday, Richard doclared that he had been watching for a timed quarter of an hour the same two slag heaps directly to leeward. Unlike all the other land we had been imagining, they were still there. They could only be Ile de Batz.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Soon they joined up and became a proper island, with the cliffs above Roscoff appearing opposite. Then a buoy went past, obviously the landfall for the Rosccff channel. Things were looking up, or were they? As the actual coast became visible, it was increasingly apparent that it was very knobbly; the lighthouse in the channel had spray bursting 20 to 30 feet up it, what would happen when we got in amongst that lot? I decided to try to row across our track sufficiently to guide the dinghy into the Roscoff channel, in the hope that we might be able to pop into the harbour as we went past, or at least find a lee behind it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Just as I started the lighthouse dodging operation, I saw the bows of a vessel pointing at me from windward. Digging in my bag, I found a large yellow towel which we hastily lashed to an oar, and which Richard waved vigorously aloft, while I resumed rowing, trying to dodge being flogged in the face by the wet towel. The langoustier, for such it was, altered course away from us to keep to his channel, and we quite decided that he had not seen us. Then figures appeared on deck; the ship stopped, turned, and slowly took up station to windward of us; a rope was thrown, we were hauled alongside. The rolling of the ship made getting aboard relatively easy; you step on the rubbing strake as it rolls down, then you are catapulted over the bulwarks as she goes back. They gaffed our gear with an outsize boathook, then hauled up the dinghy as well.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After that life became somewhat more civilised. The crew took us down to the aft cabin, stripped us off, and delving into their own bags, found enough spare clothing to kit us out warm and dry. They brewed coffee and laced it with rum; they found some hard tack and butter, chocolate and fags; they did it all with great good humour; one can ask no more of any man.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We were not, as we thought, bound for Roscoff, but for Mogueriec, some five miles further west. Le Rayon de Soleil (she was the only sunshine we saw that day) was heading for home and Sunday dinner, and the tide being right, was taking the short cut inside lIe de Batz; otherwise . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>On arrival at Mogueriec, we met our host for the first time; he had been at the helm hitherto. M. Jean Baptiste le Bihan is a great powerful jolly man, patron-pecheur, a man of substance, and with a great heart. Initial difficulties over language soon became easier, as he has some English acquired from frequently marketing his catches in Cornish ports.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Our first visitor was the Douanier who took one look and decided he was not interested in us. Then came a gentleman who introduced himself as of the French Navy. He was subsequently described in the local newspapers as &#39;syndic des gens de mer a Roscoff&#39; and &#39;L&#39;administrateur de l&#39;inscription maritime de Morlaix&#39;. We never did discover which hat this M. Balcon was wearing that day, but he made the civilised suggestion that it would be more comfortable if he were to interview us with a glass in our hands, so we adjourned to the local cafe. Having satisfied him that &lsquo;Quiver&rsquo; was not a danger to shipping (he must have been Receiver of Wrecks as well), he undertook after making his report to his own authorities to notify the British Embassy in Paris; they in turn reported to the Foreign Office, who telephoned Richard&#39;s parents with the true story of what had happened, thus forestalling the inevitilble inaccurate press reports.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In fact, the local press were incredibly good. One reporter followed hot on M. Balcon&#39;s heels, and we went to a great deal of trouble making sure that he got the facts right - not easy explaining nautical matters to a layman in a foreign language.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The langoustier&#39;s crew were very helpful in this. Tho reporter from Ouest France appeared next day and we had to go through it all again. However, it was worth the trouble, as both the subsequent articles were absolutely accurate in all matters of fact, even to the detail that Richard was my godson. Then the BBC had to go and spoil it all by saying that we were wrecked off Finisterre (only 450 miles further on), and, amongst other things, turning Richard into my nephew. It seems there are some things the French can do better than us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, Mme. Le Bihan had gathered up all our wet garments, plus our saturated baggage, shoved them into the boot of her car, and taken all home. There she rounded up some neighbours, and they spent the whole of Saturday afternoon and evening feeding it all through the washing machine, hosing out our bags, spreading out all our other bits and pieces to dry. Sunday she spent drying and ironing, so that by Sunday afternoon we had the whole lot back, ready to pack.</blockquote></div></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="MuiPaper-root MuiPaper-elevation1 MuiPaper-rounded"><div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-container MuiGrid-align-items-xs-flex-end"><div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-xs-2"><a class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-contained jss11 MuiButton-containedSizeSmall MuiButton-sizeSmall" tabindex="0" role="button" aria-disabled="false" href="/"><span class="MuiButton-label">See more boats</span></a></div><div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-xs-3"><form novalidate="" autoComplete="off"><button class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-contained jss11 MuiButton-containedPrimary MuiButton-containedSizeSmall MuiButton-sizeSmall" tabindex="0" type="button"><span class="MuiButton-label">Contact us about this boat<span class="MuiButton-endIcon MuiButton-iconSizeSmall"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M2.01 21L23 12 2.01 3 2 10l15 2-15 2z"></path></svg></span></span></button></form></div><div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-xs-3"><button class="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-contained jss11 MuiButton-containedPrimary MuiButton-containedSizeSmall MuiButton-sizeSmall" tabindex="0" type="button"><span class="MuiButton-label">I have pictures of this boat<span class="MuiButton-endIcon MuiButton-iconSizeSmall"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M2.01 21L23 12 2.01 3 2 10l15 2-15 2z"></path></svg></span></span></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/boat/4000";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-af0ebdc9bd48c9e3dd29.js"],"app":["/app-4cde987665dfe84beda8.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-919de4b44033d32068dd.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-d61ef1fb8bbdef97bc03.js"],"component---src-templates-boattemplate-jsx":["/component---src-templates-boattemplate-jsx-c93fbe286a4ea235e668.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/polyfill-af0ebdc9bd48c9e3dd29.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/component---src-templates-boattemplate-jsx-c93fbe286a4ea235e668.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-4cde987665dfe84beda8.js" async=""></script><script src="/framework-3e6dec6139dadaa7d0c7.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-db054e942e4bdf9f76b0.js" async=""></script></body></html>
