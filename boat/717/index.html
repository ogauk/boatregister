She was built as a yacht for John Aspden of Lytham. <i>Ziska</i> spent her early life in the Irish Sea, before moving to Whitby after the Second World War. <p><i>Ziska</i> was built by Crossfield Brothers on Church Hill in Arnside. The lead partner in 1903 was John Crossfield, who moved to Conway in 1906 to set up a boat building business there. John built <i>Pacific Moon </i>(originally <i>Nama</i>) in Conway in 1913. <i>Pacific Moon</i> was sailed to Tahiti by Sidney Howard in 1931/2 featuring in his book &ldquo;Thames to Tahiti&rdquo;. <p>In 1997 after a long period of neglect <i>Ziska</i> was discovered in Cowes and restored by Ashley Butler, a 19 year old boat builder. In 1999 he sailed her across the Atlantic, spending four years cruising and racing her in the West Indies., before selling her in 2003. During his ownership she was chartered to the explorer Tim Severin who was making a film about different inspirations for Robinson Crusoe. <p><i>Ziksa</i> was shipped across America by road in 2006 to Port Townsend, Washington State on the West Coast. Port Townsend is a centre for wooden boat building with a college and festival. <p>She was purchased by Stanford Siver in 2017 who spent the next two years restoring her helped by a team of shipwrights. In 2019 <i>Ziska</i> took part in the 750 mile long Race2Alaska, which is designed to show case the latest in human and wind powered boat technology, coming 22nd of 35th starter. In 2020 she was shortlisted for the best Classic Boat Restoration under 40 foot and the Gstaad Yacht Club Centenarian of the Year. <p>The Name Ziska is short for the German girl&rsquo;s name Franziska and similar to the Yiddish girl&rsquo;s name Ziske meaning &ldquo;Little Sweet One&rdquo;. One eyed General Jan Ziska (1360-1424) is a Czech national hero. However it is probable that <i>Ziska</i> was named after &ldquo; Princess Ziska &ldquo; a novel published in 1897 by Victorian best-selling author Marie Corelli set in Egypt. The final melodramatic scene takes place in the inner chamber of the Great Pyramid. <p>There were at least two other yachts called <i>Ziska</i> built around 1900. <i>Ziska</i> (1898) was a Dublin Bay 25 footer, which was later raced at Royal Cork. <i>Ziska</i> (1904) was a Royal Windermere 17 footer. Ziska Pilsner made by the Bowness Bay Brewing Company is named after the Royal Windermere yacht. <p><div><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5drR8l1OVmM" width="560"></iframe></div> <p><font size="3"><font style="font-size: 13pt"><b>History by Year</b></font></font> <p><b>1903</b> Built by Crossfield Brothers in the Top Shop on Church Hill in Arnside for John W.Aspden of Lytham <p>John Aspden (1855 -1921) was born in Blackburn, an inland mill town. In 1891 census he lived in Fleetwood working as a fisherman. By 1901 Census he was a Sea Fisheries Bailiff living in Lytham. In 1904 he was the General Manger of Lytham Baths, a Victorian leisure complex fed by sea water. The adjacent Assembly Rooms housed the yacht club. <p><b>1904 </b>Recorded in Lloyds Register as owned by Arthur Earle-Hunt of Temissary Lodge, Do <p>Arthur Earle-Hunt (1860 &ndash; 1928) was born Arthur Hunt in Dublin. In the 1881 Census he was recorded as a bank clerk. His maternal grandfather was Thomas Earle, a Manchester solicitor. <p>His first wife Evelyn eloped with her employer James Cooper a Manchester businessman living in secret with him for 7 years. Arthur received &pound;800 damages against Cooper (about &pound;100,000 in today&rsquo;s money) when his divorce was granted in 1894. James Cooper was tried for murdering his second wife a barmaid in Douglas, Isle of Man in 1892 receiving the lenient sentence of 10 years penal servitude for man slaughter, when the usual punishment for murder would have been hanging. Both the murder trial and divorce were reported in the national press. <p>In 1894 he married Ellen Stopford of Tremissary Lodge, Douglas Isle of Man, the wealthy widow of a Manchester brewer, 9 years his senior. It is probable that the money to buy <i>Ziska</i> came from her. <p>Arthur joined the Royal Mersey Yacht Club. <p>June 1904 Arthur sold <i>Ziska</i> to John Evarard, a Douglas entrepreneur involved with various leisure businesses including Mona Steam Ship Company that offered trips round the bay. <p><b>1905</b> April: John Evarard sold <i>Ziska</i> back to Arthur Earle-Hunt<p>August: Arthur Earle-Hunt sells <i>Ziska</i> to W.J.Ellis, a Dublin solicitor. <i>Ziska</i> kept at Kingstown (Dun Laogharie), Ireland&rsquo;s leading yachting centre with three Royal Clubs<p><b>1908</b> Lloyds Register records <i>Ziska</i> as being owned by Arthur Holt and partners.

One eyed General Jan Ziska (1360-1424) is a Czech national hero. However it is probable that <i>Ziska</i> was named after &ldquo; Princess Ziska &ldquo; a novel published in 1897 by Victorian best-selling author Marie Corelli set in Egypt. The final melodramatic scene takes place in the inner chamber of the Great Pyramid. <p>There were at least two other yachts called <i>Ziska</i> built around 1900. <i>Ziska</i> (1898) was a Dublin Bay 25 footer, which was later raced at Royal Cork. <i>Ziska</i> (1904) was a Royal Windermere 17 footer.
